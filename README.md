### Simple Static Website
This repository will help beginners who have just completed the Git course & want to apply their theoretical knowledge.

### How to contribute
Geeks who are eager to contribute, must read it. 

### Creating Issues
1.Make sure you have a GitHub account.
  - Search GitHub and Google to see if your issue has already been reported - Create an issue in GitHub, assuming one does not already exist.
    -Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
    -Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
    
### Getting Started
Goto the Simple-Static-Website repository
Click on the Fork button in the upper right corner.
Introduce your self to GIT, make sure you use an email associated with your GitHub account.

git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
Make sure you clone the forked repository.

git clone https://github.com/<your username>/simple-static-website.git
Switch Simple-Static-Website to your fork

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<your username>/simple-static-website.git
Setup simple-static-website to be able to fetch from the master

git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-Codesis/simple-static-website.git
### Adding Features
When you add a new feature always create an issue first, this allows others to comment and give you tips. It will also help us keep track of what people are adding and with new releases helps us to write new release notes and give you credit for your work.

Secondly, always work in a branch, never work on the master branch. Keep your master branch in sync with the master of the official Simple-Static-Website repository. This makes the pull requests (you do want your work to be in the main branch right?) easier for us.

Finally, try to keep your branches focused on fixing/adding only one feature and try not to fall in the trap of doing a lot of things in a single branch. This will not only make it harder for us to process your pull request but makes it take longer before you can submit your pull request. Small pull requests are more likely to be looked at faster and pulled into the main branch faster.

Here is a simplified workflow on how to add a new feature:

### Syncing with fork
Syncing your forked repository to the original repository is an important step before submitting any pull request to the original repository. So, it goes something like, you fetch from the original repository (Upstream Repository) to your working area (your local copy) and merge it with the fork's master branch and then you push it to your forked Github repository.

You can see all your remotes with git remote -v, if you don't have upstream set as https://github.com/The-Codesis/simple-static-website.git, set up the original repository as your upstream.

git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-Codesis/simple-static-website.git
By now, you have set the upstream as the original repository i.e. https://github.com/The-Codesis/simple-static-website.git and the origin as the forked repository i.e. https://github.com/<your username>/simple-static-website.git.

Now, fetch all of the changes from the original repository (note that commits to the original repository will be stored in a local branch called, upstream/master).

git fetch upstream
Since you want fork's master branch and the original's master branch should be synced, so make sure you are on fork's master branch and merge the changes from the upstream/master into your fork's local master branch (you may need to resolve the conflicts).

git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
At this point, your local branch is synced to the original repository's master branch. To update your forked Github repository, you need to push your changes to the forked Github repository.

git push origin master
### Alternative
git fetch only downloads the changes from the upstream and doesn't integrate those into your forked repository. You have to use an additional command git merge to do so. Alternatively, git pull not only downloads the changes but also integrate those into your forked repository.
```
Set up the original repository as your upstream.

git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-Codesis/simple-static-website.git
Now, fetch and merge the changes from the original repository simultaneously.
```
git pull upstream master
Update your forked Github repository.
```
git push origin master
To summarize, see the section below.
```
### Get latest version
Update your master (both locally and on GitHub)

git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
git push
### Git Merge VS Git Rebase
Rebasing and merging are both used for integrating changes from one branch into anotherâ€”but they do it in different ways.

Instead of

git merge upstream/master
you can also use

git rebase upstream/master
### The Merge Option
git merge will integrate the histories of the upstream branch and your master branch, giving you a branch structure that looks like:
```

Merging preserves history since, the existing branches are not changed in any way.Merging adds a new commit to the history.

The Rebase Option
git rebase will move the entire upstream branch on the tip of your master branch, giving you a branch structure that looks like:

IMAGE
```
Rebasing re-writes the history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.

Which command to prefer?
git rebase is usually preferred over git merge because

It results in a perfectly linear and readable history.
It eliminates the unnecessary merge commits required by git merge.
It can remove undesired commits or squash two or more commits into one.
### Create a branch to do your work.
A good practice is to call the branch in the form of GH- followed by the title of the issue. This makes it easier to find out the issue you are trying to solve and helps us to understand what is done in the branch. Calling a branch my-work is confusing. Names of a branch can not have a space, and should be replaced with a hyphen.

git checkout -b GH-issuenumber-title-of-issue
### Work and commit
Do you work, and commit as you see fit. Make your commit messages helpful.

In general commit messages follow these guidelines

A brief commit message in one or two lines
Followed By

Detailed explanation of your commit 

eg : If this commit fixes a bug in the code then describe the bug, what was causing it, your solution or 
any other relevant thing one should know if someone else works on this project.
See this commit format

You can also refer this article on how to write commit messages.

### Push your changes up to GitHub.
If this is the first time pushing to GitHub you will need to extended command, otherwise, you can simply do a git push.

git push -u origin GH-issuenumber-title-of-issue
### Pull Request
When finished create a pull request from your branch to the main Simple-Static-Website repository.

When making a pull request use Closes #(issue_number) in the description of your PR, so that GitHub automatically associates your PR with that issue.

In the description of your PR, mention what bug or feature this provides. Give any relevant information, that you think maintainer should know like :

Tests you did to check your new PR or code

Your approach to the problem

Any other relevant information that you think one might keep in mind for future

Make it clear,complete and simple so your PR gets merged easily !

Refer this Git Fork and Pull Request Cheat Sheet

### Code Review
You can also help the community by reviewing other people's PR, this is known as code review

Go to a PR, then Files Changed section, review the code and mark the file as reviewed

You can also use GitHub's WebUI to add comments and provide some suggestions for PR's author.

Refer this link to know about Code Reviews and its importance.

### Using GitHub UI :
GitHub provides a Web UI to make communication process easier

You can use @(account_name) to mention someone

Mentioning Pull Requests or issues using #(issue_id), Read this

Also, take a look at this, Markdown or styling your messages to increase readibilty for PR description and conversations.
